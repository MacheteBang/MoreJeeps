# More Jeeps

*A simple "game" of counting how many Jeeps you see on a road trip.*

Shortly after my son was born, I purchased a 2 door Jeep Wrangler JK and joined a local jeep club to do a little offroading. With that, there were always jeeps around.  Once he could start talking, my son would say "More Jeeps!" every time he saw one while on a drive.

10 years later, it's now a game we still play in the car, where by the end of the trip, the winner is the person who saw the most number of Jeep Wranglers _first_!
